# Object detection using YOLOv5

Scripts for fine-tuning **YOLOv5s** with the [Face Mask Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection) dataset.

[The tutorial version of this code can be found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fleetingfocus/object-detection-using-yolov5)

To run the code locally, clone this repository with  *git clone h<span>ttps://</span>github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 -q* , then create a [Kaggle API token](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials) and replace *your_username* and *your_key* in line 13 of *setup.sh* with your credentials. Now you just run *auto_train.sh* and wait! :)
